The purpose of this folder to contain scripts which make use of the UML
framework. The expectation is that these scrips will be run via invocation of
python on the command line, and thus as the main script, outside of the package
structure. Both relative and absolute imports to the contents of UML therefore
require extra setup, which is defined in a function in the allowImports module. 
For scripts that are meant to be called as main, the following code must
be included at the begining of each file in order to allow imports from UML:

from allowImports import boilerplate
boilerplate()

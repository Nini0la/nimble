The purpose of this folder to contain scripts which make use of the UML
framework. The expectation is that these scrips will be run via invocation of
python on the command line, and thus as the main script, outside of the package
structure. Both elative and absolute imports to the contents of UML require
extra setup. The following code, added to the begining of each script contained
in this directory, will allow for imports to be successful:

# PEP 366 'boilerplate', plus the necessary import of packages
if __name__ == "__main__" and __package__ is None:
	import sys
	# add UML parent directory to sys.path 	
	sys.path.append(sys.path[0].rsplit('/',2)[0])
	import UML
	import UML.applications
	__package__ = "UML.applications"

### Documentation ###
* API Documentation will now link to the QueryString object in docstring text

### Cheat Sheet ###
* For html: now formatted as a browser-width sensitive vertical accordion.
* For pdf: now formatted as a two page vertical stack with larger font.
* Typo and clarity corrections.

### Hyperparameter Tuning ###
* Replaced and generalized the previous Cross Validate functionality.
* Each learning function now takes a Tuning object.
* This object specifies two things:
-- A selection process, which specifies how to search through the argument set possibilities.
-- The possibilities are: BruteForce, Consecutive, Bayesian, and Iterative
-- A validation process, which specifies how to evaluate the perforence of an argument set.
-- The possibilities are: KFold, LeaveOneOut, LeaveOneGroupOut, HoldOutData, HoldoutPorportion.
-- There are other contextual parameters to Tuning depending on the choosen selection or validation process.
* Instead of marking parameters to be tuned with nimble.CV, the object nimble.Tune is now used.
-- This allows for not just a list of possibilities, but to specify a range.
* See the Tuning object's documentation for more details.
* Some functions and parameters have been shifted or removed to be consistent with the new style.

### returnType ###
* "DataFrame" can now be auto-detected as the returnType in data constructor functions.
* returnType was made optional with None, the default, triggering auto-detection.

### Small Changes ###
* The SessionConfiguration object / nimble.settings now has a __repr__ implementation.
* The ones, zeros, and identity data creation functions now generate int valued output.
* Support for automatic pointName detection for csv files with a header row that starts with a missing value.
-- This is the format of how pandas records csv files.

### Bug Fixes ###
* Points / Features __repr__ can now handle fully missing valued points and features.

### Deprecation ###
* Python 3.6 reached EOL Dec 2021. Support for it has been removed.
* The mlpy package, since it required python 3.6 , has been removed.
* The shogun package, since it required python 3.6, has been removed.

### Documentation Changes ###
* Provide more information on data object from API Documentation page
* Add hyperlinked list of concepts covered in each example
* Open hyperlinks to API documentation in examples as a new tab
* Clarifications in examples and docstrings
* Removed cells specific to online examples from downloadable notebooks

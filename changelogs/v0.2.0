-- nans correctly handled by nimble.calculate functions

* Documentation
-- See Also sections vastly more populated
-- cheat sheet for introductory clarity and easy visual searching
-- search tags/keywords added to most functions
-- word choice changes for cleaner search results
-- various typo / sentence clarity improvements from feedback.

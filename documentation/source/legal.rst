Online Services and Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Certain Product functionality may require the Software to access collections of data available
through external servers. SW makes no warranty that access to such data will be uninterrupted or
that the data itself will be error-free. SW reserves the right to restrict access to, add, update,
modify or remove collections of data based on availability or otherwise at SW’s discretion. You
agree all data access and use shall be limited to the Permitted Uses, and agree not to access or
use data collections in such a manner that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the servers
providing such data. Access to the online services is provided to You at SW's discretion, and may
be terminated or restricted at any time.

Limited Warranty and Disclaimer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SW does not warrant that the Product is free from all errors and/or omissions, and in fact it may
contain them. Except as specifically set forth above, the Product is provided "as is." SW makes no
representations or warranties, express, statutory or implied, with respect to the Product or the

SW, and its agents, representatives, and independent contractors, shall not be obligated to provide
or liable, under any circumstances, for providing information on or corrections to errors and/or

omissions. SW does not recommend the use of the Product for applications in which errors and/or
omissions could threaten life, injury or significant loss. Some states do not allow the exclusion
of implied warranties, so this may not apply to You. This warranty gives You specific legal rights,
and You may also have other rights that vary from state to state. This Agreement is governed by the
laws of the State of New York in the United States of America without effect to any choice of
law provisions.

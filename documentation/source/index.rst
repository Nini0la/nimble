Welcome to Nimble!
==================

Nimble is built on top of Python's most popular data science and machine
learning libraries to provide a single, easy to use, API for any data science
job. We believe the best way to learn about nimble is to see it in action. So,
we invite you to check out the examples below and explore how nimble makes
data science easier.

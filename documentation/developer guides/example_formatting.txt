The python (.py file) examples written for nimble utilize a special formatting
within the comments and docstrings to enable them to be converted to .ipynb
files for use with Jupyter notebooks. There is an object in conf.py which
creates these files when the documentation is rendered so that they are
always up to date with the .py example file. The notebook files are a JSON
format and contain cells with either python code or markdown.

Each example starts with a docstring. Within this docstring, the standard
markdown formatting applies. The standard for examples is the following:

"""
# Example Heading

### Example Subheading

Markdown paragraph with additional information about the example.
"""

Any code within a multiline string will have 

For the remainder of the file, comments starting with '##' denote content
intended to be converted to markdown. For subheadings, the comment should
also end with the appropriate number of '#'. Here is an example.

## Example Subheading ##

## Markdown paragraph text
example = 'example'
# Python comment
print(example)
